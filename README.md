EOR is an abbreviation of Everything on Rent. This is a tentative name for the application. This Application allows users to add multiple products from multiple categories on rent. On the other hand, it also allows clients to search for required products to rent. The concept behind this application is to change the liabilities of your household to your asset so even if you are sitting in your home or doing your job, your assets can go and earn you some extra money and vice-versa a you can just rent a product, which you only need to use once, and not buy it saving your money.
